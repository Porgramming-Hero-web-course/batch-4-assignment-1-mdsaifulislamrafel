# Problem 7 :
## A class named Car has been created with three properties: make, model, and year.

## How it works:
### Constructor: The class constructor initializes the three properties (make, model, and year) when a new Car object is created.

#### getAge Method:

* The getAge method calculates the car’s age by finding the difference between the current year and the car’s manufacture year (year).
* It retrieves the current year using new Date().getFullYear().
### Output:

* console.log displays the output of getAge, showing the car’s age along with the current year in the format (assuming current year is ${new Date().getFullYear()}).
* This way, the car’s age is displayed along with a reference to the current year.
