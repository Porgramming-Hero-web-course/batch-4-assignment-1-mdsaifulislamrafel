### The Importance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript
### TypeScriptâ€™s Union and Intersection types are powerful tools for creating flexible and precise type definitions.

## Union Types: Flexibility
* Union types allow a variable to accept multiple types, making functions more versatile. For example:

## Intersection Types: Precision
* Intersection types combine multiple types into one, ensuring a variable meets all conditions of each type.

## Why They Matter
* Union Types add flexibility by accepting multiple types.
* Intersection Types enforce strict type requirements for more complex data structures.
* Using union and intersection types leads to more reliable, readable, and maintainable TypeScript code.
